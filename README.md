## üó∫Ô∏è Project Overview

The **Web Scraper and Automation Suite** is designed to automate the process of web scraping, data extraction, and integration with the OpenAI API for content summarization. The tool extracts data from websites, processes the information using OpenAI‚Äôs language models, and then outputs the summarized data into CSV files, making it an essential tool for data-driven projects.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- **Web Scraping**: Automatically scrape data from websites using cURL or similar libraries. Extract useful content like headings, paragraphs, and links.
- **OpenAI Integration**: Generate summaries or structured information from the scraped content using OpenAI API (GPT-3 or GPT-4).
- **CSV Export**: Output the summarized data into a well-formatted CSV file, which can be easily shared or processed further.
- **Customizable Automation**: Allows customization of scripts for specific use cases, enabling flexible automation for various projects.

### üìå To-Do Features

- **Real-Time Data Scraping**: Implement real-time data scraping and updating for websites with dynamic content.
- **Enhanced Data Visualization**: Build a dashboard that displays scraped data and summaries in a more visual format.
- **Multi-Site Scraping**: Extend the tool to scrape multiple websites concurrently or in parallel for more efficiency.

## üìã Requirements

To run the project, you‚Äôll need the following:

- **PHP**: The primary language used for scraping, OpenAI API calls, and CSV generation.
- **cURL**: To make HTTP requests and scrape website data.
- **OpenAI API Access**: For content summarization using GPT-3 or GPT-4.
- **Google Sheets API**: (Optional) If you're storing or processing the data into Google Sheets.

## üîß Troubleshooting Tips
**API Authentication Issues:**

* Make sure your OpenAI API key is correctly set in ```config/openai_config.php```

* Ensure the credentials file is in the correct location.

* Google Sheets Update Error (if applicable):

   *   Verify that the sheet name and structure are correct.

    *  Ensure that the Google Sheets API is set up and the sheet is shared with your API credentials.

**cURL Errors:**

   *   If you encounter issues with the scraping, make sure cURL is enabled in your PHP setup.

   *   Check for any connectivity issues with the website you are trying to scrape.

## üí° Usage Examples

Here‚Äôs a simple example of how to use the **Web Scraper and Automation Suite** with OpenAI integration:

```php
// Include necessary files
include('config/config.php');
include('config/openai_config.php');
include('scraper/scraper.php');
include('scraper/utils.php');
include('openai/openai_api.php');
include('csv/csv_generator.php');

// Set the domain URL to scrape
$domain = 'https://example.com';

// Scrape the website
$html_content = scrape_website($domain);

// Extract data from the HTML
$extracted_data = extract_data_from_html($html_content);

// Generate a summary using OpenAI API
$summary = call_openai_api($extracted_data);

// Prepare data for CSV export
$data = [
    [$domain, $summary, implode('; ', $extracted_data), date('Y-m-d H:i:s')]
];


// Generate the CSV file
$csv_filename = 'website_summary_' . date('Y-m-d_H-i-s') . '.csv';
generate_csv($data, $csv_filename);

[echo "Process completed. CSV file created: " . $csv_filename;```
